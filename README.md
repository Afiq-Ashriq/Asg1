## ----Assignment 1----
For this assignment I am tasked to create a website for a fictional company or a rea/fake band

I chose to create a website for a real band. 
The band I chose is RAMMSTEIN.


## ----Design Process----
Who is the website for: My target audience would be fans/new fans/possbile fans of the band
and this website will show the past shows and live shows, the History of the band, 
the stories of each member of the band, promote some merchandise, some pictures of the band.

-As a visitor of the website, I want the website to be easy to navigate.

-As a visitor of the website, I want the website to go easy on my eyes. E.g. I dont want to have to strain my eyes to view anything.

-As a fan of the band visiting the website, I would want the website's theme to fit the band

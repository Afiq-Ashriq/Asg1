## ----Assignment 1----
For this assignment I am tasked to create a website for a fictional company or a real/fake band

I chose to create a website for a real band. 
The band I chose is RAMMSTEIN.


## ----Design Process----
Who is the website for: My target audience would be fans/new fans/possbile fans of the band
and this website will show upcoming live shows, the History of the band, 
the profile of each member of the band, promote some merchandise and show some pictures of the band.

-As a visitor of the website, I want the website to be easy to navigate.

-As a visitor of the website, I want the website to go easy on my eyes. E.g. I dont want to have to strain my eyes to view anything.

-As a fan of the band visiting the website, I would want the website's theme to fit the band

I chose a black,white and red theme as it fits the band's theme.

For my navigation bar, I have decided to make it simple.
 The home page will consist of the featured music video in the header, followed by latest videos of the band and then the gallery and finally the store that will link to the band's merchandise shop.



## ----Features----

EXISTING FEATUERS
Feature 1 - Navigation bar at the top for easy navigation of the website
Feature 2 - Clicking on the logo at the top of the website brings user to home page
Feature 3 - Form in the footer for users to sign up to receive news about the band. It will include javascript to print out a message when the sign up button is clicked.
